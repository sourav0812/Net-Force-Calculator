# üß≤ Net Force Vector Calculator
This project answers a fundamental question in physics and engineering:

‚ÄúIf multiple forces are acting on an object from different angles, what is the total effect?‚Äù

Built in Python, this calculator takes in multiple force vectors (each with a magnitude and direction), breaks them into components, and calculates the net force vector ‚Äî its overall magnitude and direction.

‚öôÔ∏è What It Does
Accepts any number of force inputs (magnitude + angle in degrees)

Converts each force into horizontal and vertical components

Adds all components to compute the net force acting on an object

Outputs:

Total net force magnitude

Total net force direction (in degrees)

Optional: Visualize all individual vectors and the net result using Matplotlib

üåâ Real-World Applications
This type of vector analysis is used in:

Bridge and structural design: Engineers analyze how cables or beams pull/push at different angles to ensure structures don‚Äôt collapse.

Physics problems: Think of boxes being pulled by ropes or friction, with forces coming from multiple directions.

Robotics and drones: Multiple motors or thrusters apply force in different directions ‚Äî this calculation determines movement.

Aerospace and navigation: Planes or ships are affected by wind, thrust, and drag ‚Äî net force determines actual movement.

üß† What I Practiced
Vector decomposition and trigonometry in code (sin, cos, atan2)

Structuring calculations in Python using clean, modular logic

Visualizing vector addition using Matplotlib

Applying textbook physics in a real, programmable context
